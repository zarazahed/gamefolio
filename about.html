    <div id="panel-text">Hi, there, my name is Zara! :D Here's some information about me: <br><br>
      I'm a high schooler who likes coding. I first started coding at a young age, building simple<br>
       games on Scratch, and learning more about different languages from Khan Academy
       <br>courses. Hackclub has helped me get back into coding, so I've recently started making more projects! ^v^<br><br>
      
 Some of my favourite shows are Avatar: the last Airbender, Frieren: Beyond Journey's End, Attack on Titan, and Haikyuu!! I also like playing games. I adore the Paper Mario series, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and, as you may have guessed, Stardew Valley.<br><br>
