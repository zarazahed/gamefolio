      Dessert Rater is a simplistic website for rating how delicious different desserts look.  It was <br> built using HTML and CSS. <br>

This is a simple website I made to showcase my hobbies. It was built using HTML, CSS, and<br> Javascript. I made it for Hackclub's overflow:hidden YSWS. It was a challenge to create a <br>website that doesn't require scrolling to reveal information.<br>
